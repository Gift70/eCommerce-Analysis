Overview

In todayâ€™s highly competitive e-commerce market, data-driven decision-making is essential for sustainable growth. This analysis examines an extensive dataset to highlight trends in sales, customer behavior, and revenue generation. Using SQL-based queries, I identified insights that can help businesses improve marketing, boost customer retention, and increase profits.

Key Findings & Recommendations;

1. Top-Selling Products vs. Revenue-Generating Products

â€¢	Products with high sales volumes also contribute significantly to overall revenue.

â€¢	While high-priced products may generate substantial revenue per unit, their overall contribution is lower due to fewer sales.

Why It Matters: Understanding which products drive the most revenue allow businesses to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

Recommendations:

Ensure consistent stock availability for high-demand products.

Leverage targeted promotions to further boost sales of best-selling items.

Bundle high-priced products with best-sellers to boost order value.

2. Revenue Distribution & Product Performance

â€¢	The electronics category accounts for the majority of revenue, significantly outperforming other product categories.

â€¢	Underperforming categories may be suffering from low demand, poor pricing, or inadequate marketing.

Why It Matters: Over-reliance on a single category can be risky, diversifying product offerings can help stabilize long-term growth.

Recommendations:

Explore opportunities to strengthen sales in underperforming categories.

Introduce related products to the electronics segment to enhance cross-selling.

Expand the product variety to reduce dependency on the best-seller.


3. High-Value Customers Drive the Majority of Sales

â€¢	A small group of loyal customers generates a large portion of total revenue.

â€¢	These customers frequently make repeat purchases and engage with the brand.

Why it matters: Losing high-value customers can result in a significant revenue decline.

Recommendations:

Launch a loyalty program with personalized benefits.

Offer exclusive deals or early access to new products.

Improve the post-purchase experience to encourage repeat orders.

4. Customer Churn & Retention Challenges

â€¢	Some customer groups show high churn risk, likely due to low engagement or poor experience

â€¢	Churn is particularly high among one-time buyers or infrequent shoppers.

Why it matters: High churn rates can weaken long-term revenue growth and retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

Recommendations:

Identify at-risk customers early and re-engage them with special offers.

Use targeted email campaigns and discounts to bring back inactive users.

Improve customer support and streamline the shopping experience to boost retention.

5. Customer Engagement & Purchase Behavior by Traffic Source

â€¢	Organic search and paid ads are the leading traffic sources, driving the highest number of customer purchases.

â€¢	Social media follows in ranking, while email and direct traffic show slower sales and lower order volumes.

Why It Matters: Understanding which traffic sources drive high-value customers helps optimize marketing spend and acquisition strategies.

Recommendations:

Invest in Search Engine optimization to attract high-intent organic visitors.

Continuously refine paid ad targeting to maximize return on ad spend.

Implement retargeting campaigns for users acquired via ads to increase retention.

6. Seasonal Trends & Sales Fluctuations

â€¢	Sales show noticeable spikes during specific months, indicating seasonal demand.

â€¢	Certain products perform exceptionally well during peak shopping periods.

Why It Matters: Understanding seasonal trends can help businesses plan inventory and marketing campaigns more effectively.

Recommendations:

Stock up on high-demand products before peak seasons.

Launch time-sensitive promotions to capitalize on seasonal shopping trends.

Use predictive analytics to anticipate future seasonal demand.

7. Refund Rate & Customer Satisfaction

â€¢	Higher refund rates in certain product categories suggest potential issues with product quality, misleading descriptions, or unmet customer expectations.

â€¢	Excessive refunds not only affect profitability but also impact customer trust and brand reputation.

Why It Matters: Understanding refund patterns helps businesses improve product quality and reduce unnecessary costs.

Recommendations:

Identify and resolve common reasons for refunds.

Conduct detailed quality assurance checks to ensure product consistency.

Offer easy but structured refund processes to maintain customer trust while minimizing losses.

Implement a proactive customer support system to address concerns before refunds become necessary.

Conclusion
